- **Building Blocks Palette**: Pre-built components for common contract elements:
  - State variables (public/private)
  - Functions with customizable parameters and visibility
  - Constructor configuration
  - Logic nodes (if statements, comparisons, assignments)
  - Expression nodes (math operations, logical operations, literal values)
- **Real-time Code Generation**: Automatically generates Solidity code as you build
- **Visual Flow Control**: Connect nodes to define execution flow and logic
- **Smart Contract Templates**: Quick start with common contract patterns

### Advanced IDE Features
- **Monaco Editor Integration**: Full-featured code editor with syntax highlighting
- **Multi-compiler Support**: Compatible with various Solidity compiler versions
- **Real-time Compilation**: Instant feedback on code errors and warnings
- **ABI Generation**: Automatic Application Binary Interface generation
- **Bytecode Analysis**: View compiled contract bytecode

### Deployment & Testing
- **One-Click Deployment**: Deploy contracts directly from the interface
- **Wallet Integration**: Connect with popular Web3 wallets
- **Multi-network Support**: Deploy to various blockchain networks
- **Deployment Tracking**: Monitor deployed contracts with transaction hashes and addresses
- **Contract Interaction**: Test deployed contracts directly in the interface

### Code Management
- **Project Organization**: Manage multiple contracts and files
- **File Explorer**: Navigate through project structure
- **Code Preview**: Multiple tabs for source code, ABI, errors, and deployment info
